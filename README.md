# AssisTV

In Ireland 1 in 3 people over the age of 65 live alone and 60% of the same age demographic have at least one chronic disease or disorder. The global population is aging, with an expected global population of 1 billion over 65s by 2030. With few technological advancements catered towards the elderly, our elders are being left behind in a technical age, causing isolation and a societal disconnect. The increasing costs of care affects those who cannot afford it the most. Lack of appropriate care and loneliness has proven to have detrimental effects on health and cognitive abilities.
We are developing a product, with the support of the Irish charity, ALONE, to help elderly people integrate into the community and live more independently at home, in an effort to improve the everyday life of the aging population.
